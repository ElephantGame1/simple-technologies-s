         Q.W.C 2
Quality writing code
     Variables 
1 name variables 

they should be named clearly and qualitatively
2 data types
there are type variables: int float bool str
3 how to write
int name_variable 57
float name_variable 78,9
bool name_variable true
bool name_variable false
str name_variable hello
mandatory type name value must be written with a space
             arithmetic operations


1 how it works
write out keyword for additions intS , floatS , strS
then specify the name of the variable and what you want to add which numbers or variables for the minus floatM , intM and specify everything the same as for the sum
for multiplication
intU , floatU
specify everything the same as for the sum for division
intD , floatD
specify everything the same as for the amount
remainder of the division
intP , floatP specify everything the same as for the amount


2 how to write

For additions
intS variable_name 34 56
floatS variable_name 34,56 56,34
strS variable_name hel lo

For minus
intM variable_name 34 56
floatM variable_name 34,56 56,34
For multiplication
intU variable_name 34 56
floatU variable_name 34,56 56,34

For division
intD variable_name 34 56
floatD variable_name 34,56 56,34

For the remainder of a number
intP variable_name 34 56
floatP variable_name 34,56 56,34

variables instead of numbers

be sure not to put arithmetic signs, write everything with a space
       ENVELOPE OF NUMBERS

1 how it works
you write the keyword convert, then specify which type to convert to, then specify the name of the variable, then from which type and the number or variable itself
2 how to write
convert int variable_name float 34,67

the types can be used all that are
instead of numbers , you can use variables
       Comparing numbers

1 how it works
you specify the compare keyword, then write how you want to compare , more is big , more or equal is bigEarly , less is lesser , less or equal is lesserEarly , absolute is equals and not equal is unequal after that specify the name with a variable (saved in the bull type)
2 how to write
сompare big variable_name 5 4
сompare bigEarly variable_name 4 4
сompare lesser variable_name 4 5
сompare lesserEarly variable_name 5 5
сompare equals variable_name 5 5
сompare unequal variable_name 5 4

       Output to the screen
1 how it works

you write the keyword log or Dlog write if just a line that is not a variable then write log hello Dlog hello if with a variable then specify the type and the variable itself log int a Dlog int b
Dlog outputs log in one line with enter

in the 1.2 version, the output and outPut commands were added, these commands are much better than log and Dlog in that they do not need to specify the data type and can be plussed (as a string) with a ~ sign so that a space needs a / sign it works for all commands that display on the screen outPut differs from output in that outPut goes to a new line , but output does not
2 usage examples

outPut hello~world 
conclusion: 
helloworld

outPut helloworld 
conclusion: 
helloworld


outPut hello/world 
conclusion: 
hello world


       User input
1 how it works
you write the keyword enter, then the type, then the variable name, then the question (NOT OPTIONAL) in the 1.2 version, the / is a space sign appeared
2 how to write
enter int variable_name age?
enter str variable_name name?
enter float variable_name 
enter int variable_name age?/:/
conclusion: 
age? :   here you write a number
here you write a number - this is the user input itself , the user in this case I am
     How to compile
There is an ide there, write code and compile, but if you want to compile without an ide, there is a developer console in the folder where this documentation is called consoleDevelop.exe click and follow the instructions
